Lots of experimenting going on here:
Trying out server/client code sharing using requirejs
Writing everything in coffeescript with the requirejs coffeescript plugin
Trying out backbone.js to organize the code
Using Socket.io for multiplayer
Using features built into postgres for user authentication, guids, etc
Allowing players to collaboratively edit the world
